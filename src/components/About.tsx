            I am Sargam Poudel, a CS sophomore with a huge interest in
            technology.

          <p>
            Regardless of wherever I am right now, I was born and brought up in
            
          </p>
          <p>
            I wrote my first code after the lockdown in 2021, and since then,
            I&apos;ve been very fascinated with doing this and even considering
            it as my profession.
          </p>
          <p>
            Github is my favorite place to be. I do a lot of things there and
            contribute heavily to Open Source.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are a few people who helped me get started writing code. I
            have a huge respect for them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now I&apos;ve attained enough knowledge so that I can give back to
            the community. I really like helping others who are trying to get
            into this field.
